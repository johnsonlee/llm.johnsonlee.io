## Before We Start

## What Is a "Large Language Model"?

- **Language Model** — a computer program that learns to read and write human language
- **Parameters** — inside an LLM there are countless adjustable switches, each one is a parameter. Training is the process of tuning these switches until the LLM learns language
- **Large** — early language models had millions of parameters; today's LLMs have hundreds of *billions*. That jump from millions to hundreds of billions is why they're called "large"
- They're so big that they need entire rooms full of powerful computers just to run!

> The surprising thing: when you make them big enough, they start doing things nobody taught them to do.

## Who Is This For?

- Curious kids who want to know how AI chatbots work
- Beginners who are just starting to learn about AI
- Anyone who wants a simple overview of LLM research

----

## Who Is This NOT For?

- ML researchers who already read papers daily
- Advanced engineers looking for implementation details
- People who want math-heavy deep dives

----

## What Should You Know?

- You can read English (you're doing it right now!)
- You're curious about how computers learn to talk
- That's it! No math or coding experience needed
